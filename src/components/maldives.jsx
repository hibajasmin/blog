             The MALDIVES is a destination like none other; a tiny island nation in the Indian Ocean with immaculate beaches, the clearest blue waters, incredible marine life,
             overwater bungalows and so much more â€“ a bucket list destination in every way!The Maldives is world-famous for its myriad of marine life, and is considered to be one
             of the best snorkelling and diving locations in the world. Swim freely in the Indian Ocean among the colourful arrays of corals, rays, sea turtles, reef sharks and a
             multitude of other underwater species!Remote Location and Import Costs:- The Maldives is a remote island nation, which means almost everything, from food to construction
             materials, needs to be imported. Transportation costs are high, and this expense is passed on to the consumer, contributing to the overall high costs in the country.
